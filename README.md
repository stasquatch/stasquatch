# About me

**Pronouns**: she/her

You can call me Stacy, Stace, or Stasquatch. I'm currently a senior full-stack engineer at Flatfile with a slant towards front-end. Previously, I've worked at HashiCorp and CardinalCommerce/Visa. In my previous careers, I worked as a graphic designer, marketer, and copywriter.

**Fast facts:**

🐕 I have a dog named Noodle and I won't hesitate to share pics

👽 I like hearing about ghosts, bigfoot, aliens, etc.

🐴 I'm a horse girl; I've ridden on and off for ~13 years

📓 I value structure, order, and efficiency, and strive to balance high quality with pragmatism

😀 I'm an emoji and gif enthusiast

# Values

**Be an owner**: In myself: seek a deep understanding of the codebase at both product and technical levels. In others: challenge the rest of the team to feel the same level of ownership by asking questions, engaging on PRs, and leading technical discussions.

**Leave it better than you found it**: Write tests for code I didn't write. Clean up unused code when I see it. Automate the tedious parts.

**Lift as you climb**: Know my teammates' goals. Proactively find opportunities that help my teammates. Share what I learn.

**Be pragmatic**: Be realistic about limitations and deadlines, but strive for the highest quality solution. Balance effort with impact.

# I’m familiar with

JavaScript is my comfort zone, though I have experience in Ruby/Rails and .NET. Within JavaScript, I use React, Ember, Express, and Nest frameworks/libraries.

I love writing tests of all kinds and will talk about testing strategy at any time of the day. I have experience writing tests within the Ember ecosystem (unit, integration, and acceptance), React (jest's integration and snapshot), Cypress (e2e), and automated accessibility tests (ember-a11y-testing).

Accessibility is a passion of mine, though I know I have a lot to learn on the subject.

I've also got a lot of opinions and ideas around organizational structure and processes to enable teams to iterate faster and efficiently! I've previously participated in a whole-company Agile transformation and regularly reflect on current processes to ensure all teammates are engaged and being helped, not hampered.

# I want to learn

I want to continue to be a well-rounded full-stack developer, which means more hands-on backend work and building a better understanding of infrastructure, CI/CD, and dev tooling. Specifically, I'd like to dive into Golang and create a CLI tool in my next side project.

# My working style

I prefer having one main project/task and one backburner (lower priority) task. That way, when I need a break, I can shift to a different task. In reality, I tend to take on more than I can reasonably handle 😳 .

When I ask for help, I typically am interested in just enough information to get me unblocked so I can continue investigating on my own.

When pairing, I'm more comfortable playing Navigator, which probably means I should Drive more often instead. I'm flexible! Preferably, pairing sessions will be an hour or less, otherwise I can start burning out from social interactions.

# Quirks

I have a very dry sense of humor, that I try to temper until folks get to know me better, especially in Slack.

I can be a firecracker when it comes to executing new ideas and benefit from having someone to keep me grounded in a sustainable pace.
