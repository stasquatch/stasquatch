# About me

**Pronouns**: she/her

You can call me Stacy, Stace, or Stasquatch. I'm currently a senior full-stack engineer at LaunchDarkly, contributing to Golang and React codebases. Previously, I've worked at HashiCorp and CardinalCommerce/Visa. In my previous careers, I worked as a graphic designer, marketer, and copywriter.

# Values

**Be an owner**: In myself: seek a deep understanding of the codebase at both product and technical levels. In others: challenge the rest of the team to feel the same level of ownership by asking questions, engaging on PRs, and leading technical discussions.

**Leave it better than you found it**: Write tests for code I didn't write. Clean up unused code when I see it. Automate the tedious parts.

**Lift as you climb**: Know my teammates' goals. Proactively find opportunities that help my teammates. Share what I learn.

**Be pragmatic**: Be realistic about limitations and deadlines, but strive for the highest quality solution. Balance effort with impact.

# My working style

I prefer having one main project/task and one backburner (lower priority) task. That way, when I need a break, I can shift to a different task. In reality, I tend to take on more than I can reasonably handle ðŸ˜³ .

When I ask for help, I typically am interested in just enough information to get me unblocked so I can continue investigating on my own.

When pairing, I'm more comfortable playing Navigator, which probably means I should Drive more often instead. I'm flexible! Preferably, pairing sessions will be an hour or less, otherwise I can start burning out from social interactions.

# Quirks

I have a very dry sense of humor, that I try to temper until folks get to know me better, especially in Slack.

I can be a firecracker when it comes to executing new ideas and I benefit from having someone to keep me grounded in a sustainable pace.
