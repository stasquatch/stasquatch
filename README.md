# About me

**Pronouns**: she/her

You can call me Stacy, Stace, or Stasquatch. I'm currently a senior full-stack engineer at LaunchDarkly, contributing to Golang and React codebases. Previously, I've worked at HashiCorp and CardinalCommerce/Visa. In my previous careers, I worked as a graphic designer, marketer, and copywriter.

# Values

**Be an owner**: In myself: seek a deep understanding of the codebase at both product and technical levels. In others: challenge the rest of the team to feel the same level of ownership by asking questions, engaging on PRs, and leading technical discussions.

**Leave it better than you found it**: Write tests for code I didn't write. Clean up unused code when I see it. Automate the tedious parts.

**Lift as you climb**: Know my teammates' goals. Proactively find opportunities that help my teammates. Share what I learn.

**Be pragmatic**: Be realistic about limitations and deadlines, but strive for the highest quality solution. Balance effort with impact.
